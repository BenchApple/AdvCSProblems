English Description
  If the array is empty, return false, as there are no elements to create a majority. If the array has elements, recursively find
the majority element of each half of the array. 
  If the majorities of each of the halves equal each other, return the majority of the first half. This covers two of the four potential conditions; where neither half has a majority, and where both halves 
find the same majority. If both halves don't have a majority element, it is impossible to have a majority element in the array, 
as if no element takes up more than 50% of either half, the total of any one element would not be able to be more than 50% of the 
final array.If both halves have the same majority, then there is no way for any other element to be the majority, 
and the element returned must be the full majority, since it populates at least 51% of each side of the array, resulting 
in a population greater than 50% in the entire array. 
  If the halves to not have the same majority, iterate through the array, counting each instance of each of the halves majorities
If either of the majorities have greater than 50% population, otherwise known as one have of start plus end, return that element,
as it is the majority element. Only one of these two potential majorities can the final majority, as one cannot have a total
population greater than 100%. If neither of these majorities have a population greater than 50%, return false, as there
are no majority elements.
